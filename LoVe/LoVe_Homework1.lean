/- ## Question 1 (3 points): Connectives and Quantifiers

1.1 (2 points, 0.5 each). Complete the following proofs using basic tactics such as
`intro`, `apply`, and `exact`.

Hint: Some strategies for carrying out such proofs are described at the end of
Section 3.3 in the Hitchhiker's Guide. -/

theorem B (a b c : Prop) :
    (a → b) → (c → a) → c → b :=
  sorry

theorem S (a b c : Prop) :
    (a → b → c) → (a → b) → a → c :=
  sorry

theorem more_nonsense (a b c : Prop) :
    (c → (a → b) → a) → c → b → a :=
  sorry

theorem even_more_nonsense (a b c : Prop) :
    (a → a → b) → (b → c) → a → b → c :=
  sorry

/- 1.2 (1 point). Prove the following theorem using basic tactics. -/

theorem weak_peirce (a b : Prop) :
    ((((a → b) → a) → a) → b) → b :=
  sorry


/- ## Question 2 (7 points): Logical Connectives

2.1 (1 point). Prove the following property about implication using basic
tactics.

Hints:
Hints:

* Keep in mind that `¬ a` is defined as `a → False`. You can start by invoking
  `simp [Not]` if this helps you.

* You will need to apply the elimination rule for `∨` and `False` at some point
  in the proof. -/

theorem about_Impl (a b : Prop) :
    ¬ a ∨ b → a → b :=
  sorry

/- 2.2 (2 points). Prove the missing link in our chain of classical axiom
implications.

Hints:

* One way to find the definitions of `DoubleNegation` and `ExcludedMiddle`
  quickly is to

  1. hold the Control (on Linux and Windows) or Command (on macOS) key pressed;
  2. move the cursor to the identifier `DoubleNegation` or `ExcludedMiddle`;
  3. click the identifier.

* You can use `rw DoubleNegation` to unfold the definition of
  `DoubleNegation`, and similarly for the other definitions.

* You will need to apply the double negation hypothesis for `a ∨ ¬ a`. You will
  also need the left and right introduction rules for `∨` at some point. -/

#check DoubleNegation
#check ExcludedMiddle

theorem EM_of_DN :
    DoubleNegation → ExcludedMiddle :=
  sorry

/- 2.3 (2 points). We have proved three of the six possible implications
between `ExcludedMiddle`, `Peirce`, and `DoubleNegation`. State and prove the
three missing implications, exploiting the three theorems we already have. -/

/- 2.3 (2 points). Fill in the body of the function reverse that reverses a List.
  Then write down the proof for reverse_append -/

def reverse {α : Type} : List α → List α := sorry


theorem reverse_append {α : Type} :
    ∀xs ys : List α,
      reverse (xs ++ ys) = reverse ys ++ reverse xs := sorry
