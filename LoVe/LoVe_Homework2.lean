/- **## Question 1: Map**

Recall that `map f xs` applies the function `f` to every element of the list `xs`. -/

/- 1.1. Define `map` recursively on lists. -/

def map {α β : Type} (f : α → β) : List α → List β
  | []      => []
  | x :: xs => sorry


/- 1.2. Prove that mapping the composition of two functions is equivalent to
mapping the first function and then the second function. -/

theorem map_comp {α β γ : Type} (f : α → β) (g : β → γ) :
    ∀xs : List α,
      map (fun x ↦ g (f x)) xs = map g (map f xs) :=
  sorry


/- **## Question 2: Gauss's Summation Formula**

`sumUpToOfFun f n = f 0 + f 1 + ⋯ + f n`: -/

def sumUpToOfFun (f : ℕ → ℕ) : ℕ → ℕ
  | 0     => f 0
  | m + 1 => sumUpToOfFun f m + f (m + 1)


/- 2.1. Prove the following theorem, discovered by Carl Friedrich
Gauss as a pupil.

Hints:

* The `mul_add` and `add_mul` theorems might be useful to reason about
  multiplication.

* The `linarith` tactic might be useful to reason about
  addition. -/

#check mul_add
#check add_mul

theorem sumUpToOfFun_eq :
    ∀m : ℕ, 2 * sumUpToOfFun (fun i ↦ i) m = m * (m + 1) := sorry


/- 2.2. Prove the following property of `sumUpToOfFun`. -/

theorem sumUpToOfFun_mul (f g : ℕ → ℕ) :
    ∀n : ℕ, sumUpToOfFun (fun i ↦ f i + g i) n =
      sumUpToOfFun f n + sumUpToOfFun g n := sorry


/- **## Question 3: Even and Odd**

Consider the following inductive definition of even numbers: -/

inductive Even : ℕ → Prop
  | zero              : Even 0
  | add_two (k : ℕ)   : Even k → Even (k + 2)


/- 3.1. Define a similar predicate for odd numbers, by completing the
Lean definition below. The definition should distinguish two cases, like `Even`,
and should not rely on `Even`. -/

inductive Odd : ℕ → Prop
-- supply the missing cases here


/- 3.2. Give proof terms for the following propositions, based on
your answer to question 3.1. -/

theorem Odd_3 :
    Odd 3 :=
sorry

theorem Odd_5 :
    Odd 5 :=
sorry


/- 3.3. Prove the following theorems by rule induction: -/

theorem Even_Odd {n : ℕ} (heven : Even n) :
    Odd (n + 1) :=
sorry

theorem Even_Not_Odd {n : ℕ} (heven : Even n) :
    ¬ Odd n :=
sorry


/- **## Question 4: Reflexive Transitive Closure^2** -/

/- Consider the following inductive definition of the
   reflexive transitive closure of a relation `R`,
   modeled as a binary predicate `Star' R`. -/

inductive Star' {α : Type} (R : α → α → Prop) : α → α → Prop
  | refl (a : α)      : Star' R a a
  | chain (a b c : α) : Star' R a b → R b c → Star' R a c


/- We proved the following two properties in the lecture: -/

lemma Star.closure {α : Type} (R : α → α → Prop) (a b : α) :
    R a b → Star' R a b :=
  by
    intro hab
    apply Star'.chain a a b
    { exact Star'.refl a }
    { exact hab }


theorem startransitive {α : Type} (R : α → α → Prop) (a b c : α) :
    Star' R a b → Star' R b c → Star' R a c :=
  by
    intro sab sbc
    induction sbc with
    | refl =>
        apply sab
    | chain a' b' hsrba hra'b' ih =>
        apply Star'.chain
        { exact ih }
        { exact hra'b' }


/- Prove that `Star' (Star' R)` is the same relation as `Star' R`.

You may use the above two lemmas. -/

lemma Star.Star_Iff_Star {α : Type} (R : α → α → Prop) (a b : α) :
    Star' (Star' R) a b ↔ Star' R a b :=
sorry


/- **## Question 5: Sets** -/

/- One approach to implementing sets that are extensional
   (that is, two sets are equal iff they have the same elements)
   in proof assistants is to maintain a strict order on the elements. -/


-- We will use a comparison type together with two functions
-- compare and compare_nat. We need them, instead of just using <, since
-- we use the Option ℕ type in our set definition.

inductive Comparison : Type
  | lt : Comparison
  | eq : Comparison
  | gt : Comparison

open Comparison


/- We will be working with sets of natural numbers. -/

def compare_nat : ℕ → ℕ → Comparison
  | Nat.zero, Nat.zero       => eq
  | Nat.zero, Nat.succ _     => lt
  | Nat.succ _, Nat.zero     => gt
  | Nat.succ a, Nat.succ b   => compare_nat a b


/- An `Option α` type has either the form `some a` for a value of type α or
it has the form `none`. -/

-- inductive Option.{u} : Type u → Type u
--   | Option.none : {α : Type u} → Option α
--   | Option.some : {α : Type u} → α → Option α

def compare : Option ℕ → Option ℕ → Comparison
  | none, none       => eq
  | none, some _     => gt
  | some _, none     => lt
  | some a, some b   => compare_nat a b


/- This lemma might make things easier. -/

lemma compare_nat_compares (a b : ℕ) : compare_nat a b = lt ↔ a < b := by
  induction a generalizing b with
  | zero =>
      cases b with
      | zero =>
          simp [compare_nat]
      | succ b' =>
          simp [compare_nat]
  | succ a ih =>
      cases b with
      | zero =>
          simp [compare_nat]
      | succ b' =>
          simp [compare_nat]
          rw [ih b']


/- A term of type `SetAbove (some a)` is a set whose smallest element is `a`;
a term of type `SetAbove none` is the empty set.

For example:
∅ : SetAbove none
{1,2,3} : SetAbove (some 1) -/


/-
The definition of SetAbove is similar to the definition of a list.

Similar to the list constructor List.cons, scons also takes a next element
e : ℕ and a set s : SetAbove a as arguments.

Unlike the list constructor, scons also takes as argument a proof that e is
less than a, since we ensure uniqueness by order.
-/

inductive SetAbove : Option ℕ → Type
  | snil : SetAbove none
  | scons (a : ℕ) (k : Option ℕ) :
      compare (some a) k = lt →
      SetAbove k →
      SetAbove (some a)


/- 5.1. Complete the definition `empty` that returns the empty set. -/

def empty : SetAbove none := sorry


/- 5.2. Complete the definition of a singleton set.

For each number `a`, `singleton a` should return the set `{a}`, i.e. `a → ∅`. -/

def singleton (a : ℕ) : SetAbove (some a) := sorry


/- 5.3. Complete the definition of a membership predicate that checks whether a
number `a` is a member of a set. -/

def mem (a : ℕ) {k : Option ℕ} : SetAbove k → Bool := sorry


/- 5.4. Show that an element smaller than the smallest element of the set
can (unsurprisingly) never belong to the set. -/

#check compare_nat_compares

lemma mem_lt_key_false (a : Nat) (k : Option Nat) (m : SetAbove k) :
    compare (some a) k = lt →
    mem a m = false := sorry
